# Project Summary

Given the extensive amount of data in the project and its alignment with our study objective, we have chosen to work with the dataset divided into three age ranges: 18-34, 35-49, and 50-64 years.

### Project Objectives

To design product and service offerings that meet the needs and preferences of customers to increase company profitability. In this case, we are customizing by age ranges.

### Key Questions

To achieve this, we aim to answer the following questions:

- **Which age group spends the most?**

   Here, we will analyze the type of subscription and the type of gym frequented.

- **Which activities are the most popular within each age range?**

   Activities are recorded both by user and by gym, so we will analyze both.

- **Total time spent in the gym?**

   We will examine the total gym time, age, and type of activity.

- **Does the type of gym influence customer retention and the number of subscriptions?**

   Each gym offers different activities. We want to see if this influences the number of subscriptions and the age ranges of users.

### Initial Ideas

- Offer discounts on the most popular activities within each age range.
- Offer free trials for less frequent activities within each age range.
- Promote upgrades to higher-tier subscriptions in age ranges with lower spending.
